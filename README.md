# Using the Electronic Health Record to Better Understand the Impact of Overnight Provider-Patient Interactions on Overnight Sleep Opportunities
This repository contains code used in the manuscript with the above title. The code is in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. The goal is to use provider-patient interaction data from the EHR to generate relevant sleep variables and quantify sleep opportunities.


The notebooks are numbered in order of usage. The first notebook- 1. Data Population takes the data from the EHR and filters down to the appropriate data population for this study. Once the population is set, moving through notebook 2. Varibale Derivation produces the longest uninterrupted sleep opportunity (LUSO) and interruptive episode count variables.
